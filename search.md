This repository is organized for the paper:
- A Survey on LLM Test-Time Compute via Search: Tasks, LLM Profiling, Search Algorithms, and Relevant Frameworks
    - [17 Jan 2025] Initial version published on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10069)

 But we provide information regarding the following perspectives:
1. **Year of Publication and Publication Venue**: We choose to organize the paper based on the publication information, as shown in the Table of Contents below. 
> The reason why not organize the paper list based on other persepctives is because one paper have to be listed more than once, since some papers are devised for different tasks and contains multiple LLM-Profiled Roles.
2. **Tasks**, including Reasoning, Code Generation, Web Navigation
3. **LLM-Profiled Roles**, including policy, evaluator, and transition.
4. **Search Algorithms**, including BFS, DFS, MCTS, Beam Search, and others.
